    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

    <p>The realm of music has long been a subject of fascination, 
        not only for its artistic expression but also for the intricacies 
        that drive its popularity. In recent years, with the advent of
        digital platforms and streaming services, understanding the
        factors that contribute to a song's popularity has become a
        subject of intense scrutiny and interest. From catchy melodies
        to meaningful lyrics, various elements are believed to play a 
        role in determining whether a song will become a chart-topping
        hit or fade into obscurity.</p>

    <p>Research into the correlation between different aspects of a song
        and its popularity serves not only to satisfy curiosity but also
        holds significant practical implications. For artists and 
        musicians, such insights offer valuable guidance in crafting music
        that resonates with a broader audience, potentially increasing their 
        chances of commercial success and recognition. Similarly, for record 
        labels and industry professionals, understanding these correlations 
        can inform strategic decisions regarding marketing, promotion, and 
        talent development.</p>

    <p>In this study, we delve into the multifaceted aspects of music and 
       explore the correlations between various elements and the popularity 
       of songs. Through empirical analysis and statistical modeling, we aim 
       to uncover patterns and trends that illuminate the complex interplay 
       between musical composition, lyrical content, production quality, and 
       audience reception. By doing so, we not only contribute to the body of 
       knowledge surrounding the sociology of music but also provide practical 
       insights that may benefit artists, industry professionals, and music 
       enthusiasts alike.</p>

    <h3>Tasks and Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p> Our goal was to create both static and dynamic visualizations that allow the user to
        explore the relationship between various aspects of a song and its popularity. While 
        sources like <a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-80126-7_22">
        Analyzing Music Genre Popularity</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/podcast/knowledge-at-wharton-podcast/what-makes-songs-popular-its-all-about-you/">
        What Makes Songs Popular? It’s All About ‘You’</a> focused more on the pyscological and 
        marketing aspects of what makes a song enjoyable and popular, we wanted data to paint the picture. 
        We aimed to provide an interactive experience that enables users to gain insights into the factors
        that contribute to a song's success and appeal. Our static visualizations were to accomplish
        this by displaying how danceability, speechiness, loudness effect popularity, while our dynamic
        visualizations would do so by showing how duration determines to a songs popularity by genre.</p>
        
    <p>To do this, we used <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/spotify-tracks-genre-dataset">
        The Devastator's "Spotify Tracks Genre"</a> dataset on Kaggle. This dataset contains information
        about various songs, including their popularity, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, 
        speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration, and time signature.
        Below are the aspects we chose to focus on:</p>

        <p>With such a wide range of data (89741 unique tracks), we were able to explore the relationships
            between these variables and the popularity of a song. We used various visualization techniques
            to present our findings in an engaging and informative manner. The data did not require any 
            pre-processing as well, as it was well structured and contained only pertinent data.</p>
        </p>
      </div>


        <h2>3 Static Visualizations</h2>

        <div class="box">
        <div class="center">
            <img class="series" src="visualization.png" alt="3 static visualizations PNG" style="width: 100%;">
        </div>

        <h3>Danceability vs. Popularity</h3>

        <p>In the first visualization, it can be observed that, while weak, there seems to be a positive
            correlation between danceability and popularity. As the y-axis (popularity) increases, the data
            sees a slight but noticable shift towards the upper right of the graph. This positive correlation
            displays that making a more danceable song may allow artists to boost the song's popularity. </p>

        <h3>Speeciness vs. Popularity</h3>
            
        <p>In the second visualization, there is a slight negative correlation between speechiness and popularity. 
          It is also clear that most of the songs represented in the dataset had a low speechiness level. Since this
          was a dataset from Spotify, a service that has podcasts as well as music, there were a few outliers with a
          high level of speechiness which turned out to be podcasts. For the songs, it is clear that songs that are too 
          wordy to not tend to succeed as much as ones with less words.
        </p>

        <h3>Loudness vs. Popularity</h3>
        <p>In the final visualization, there is a slight positive correlation between loudness and popularity. Most data 
          points were towards the greater end of the x-axis. This shows that songs that are louder tend to succeed more 
          than quieter songs, which make it obvious why so many songs are on the louder side of the spectrum.
        </p>



        <h2>Summary of the three scatter plots</h2>        
        <p>The key difference is that danceability shows a positive association 
            with popularity, while speechiness and loudness do not exhibit such 
            a clear relationship. This suggests that the danceability of a song,
            or its ability to inspire dancing and movement, is a more important
            factor in determining its overall popularity and commercial success
            compared to the other two attributes. Listeners may be more drawn to
            songs they can easily dance or move to, as this enhances the engaging
            and entertaining experience. In contrast, the speechiness and loudness
            of a song appear to be less directly tied to its widespread 
            popularity. Other musical, cultural, and contextual factors likely play
            a bigger role in those cases. Therefore, based on the information provided 
            in the three scatter plots, danceability seems to have the highest impact 
            on a song's popularity among the three factors analyzed.</p>

        <h2>Dynamic Visualizations</h2>
                    <div class="box">
    
        <div class = 'container'>

                <h3>Duration vs. Popularity</h3>
                <p> To interact with this visualization, the user can click on the 
                    dropdown and select which genre they would like to highlight. Then, 
                    both the scatter plot and bar chart only show the data that falls into 
                    the genre that is selected. Based on the scatter plot provided, it appears 
                    that the duration of a song does have a relationship with its popularity, though 
                    the connection is not entirely straightforward.</p>

                <p>Key observations:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wider spread at longer durations: The data points are
                            more widely scattered and dispersed at the longer song 
                            durations (towards the right side of the x-axis), indicating 
                            that song popularity is more variable for longer-duration tracks.</li>
                        <li>Concentration at shorter durations: The data points are more densely
                            clustered towards the left side of the x-axis, representing shorter 
                            song durations. This suggests that songs with shorter durations 
                            (e.g. under 200,000 ms or around 3 minutes) tend to be more consistently 
                            popular.</li>
                        <li>Lack of clear linear trend: While there is some visual pattern 
                            in the data, it does not follow a clear linear or exponential 
                            relationship. The scatter is more diffuse, without a strong upward or 
                            downward sloping trend across the full duration range.</li>
                        <li>Potential optimum duration range: The most popular songs (highest
                            on the y-axis) appear to be concentrated in the 150,000 ms to 
                            300,000 ms (2.5 to 5 minute) duration range, hinting that there may 
                            be an "optimal" duration window for maximizing song popularity.</li>
                    </ol>            
                </p>

            </div>            
        </div>
        <br>


        <p> In summary, the visualization suggests that song duration does influence popularity,
            but in a more complex way. The explicit/non-explicit nature of the songs is also 
            overlaid on the chart, but it does not seem to be a dominant factor in determining 
            popularity either. Shorter durations tend to be more consistently popular, while 
            longer durations show wider variability in popularity. There may also be an optimal 
            duration range where popularity is maximized. However, other factors beyond just
            duration are likely at play in determining a song's overall success and appeal.

              <h3>Energy vs. Popularity of Explicit and Non-Explicit Songs</h3>
              <p> This scatter plot shows that the energy level of a song correlated positively with
                  its popularity. A user can interact with this visualization by selecting an explicit 
                  status in the dropdown. The scatter plot and bar chart then show the data that falls 
                  into the explicit status selected . When filtered by explicit status, we can see that 
                  explicit songs show a stronger correlation between energy and popularity. In non-explicit 
                  songs, the correlation is still positive but less strong. </p>

              <!-- <p>Key observations:

                      <li>Wider spread at longer durations: The data points are

    <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>

    <p>Overall, it is clear that there are many different factors that contribute to the popularity of a song. A 
      successful song, based on our visualizations, is one that is danceable, not too wordy, loud, short in duration, 
      and has high energy. In the future, we can conduct studies on these individual attributes per genre. While it was 
      great to observe this data for all types of songs, these conclusions may be slightly different per genre and that 
      data may also be interesting to study. If we were to conduct that research, we could then target artists from those 
      genres with advice and strategies to succeed in their respective genres. </p>
